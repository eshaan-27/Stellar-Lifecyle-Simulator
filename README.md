Stellar Lifecycle Simulator

The **Stellar Lifecycle Simulator** is an interactive program that visualizes the lifecycle of stars based on their mass. It uses `pygame` for graphical simulation and `tkinter` for user input.

#Features

- **Dynamic Stellar Evolution**: Simulates the lifecycle of stars based on their mass:
  - **Low-Mass Stars (< 8 Solar Masses)**: Ends as a White Dwarf.
  - **Medium-Mass Stars (8â€“20 Solar Masses)**: Ends as a Neutron Star.
  - **High-Mass Stars (> 20 Solar Masses)**: Ends as a Black Hole.
- **Supernova Explosion**: Visualizes a supernova explosion with particle effects.
- **Accretion Disk**: Displays an accretion disk around black holes.
- **Interactive Controls**: Use the `SPACE` key to progress through the stages of the star's lifecycle.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library
